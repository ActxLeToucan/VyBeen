# VyBeen
**A realtime music streaming website in pure JS/NodeJS.**

## Run the website
To run the nodeJS server, be sure that a recent version of nodeJS is installed.
Next, go at the project's root folder and do:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```
The NodeJS server will now listen on port 5621

## Youtube search
To be able to enter only keywords in the player's search bar instead of giving a youtube link:
- create a file named `ytKey.txt` in the root folder, containing your API Key for the Youtube API v3 api.
- Next, restart the server and it should work.
