# VyBeen
**A realtime music streaming website in pure JS/NodeJS.**

## Run the website
To run the nodeJS server, just go at the project's root folder and do:
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```

## Youtube search
To be able to enter only keywords in the player's search bar instead of giving a youtube link:
- create a file named `yt-token.txt` in the `src/` folder, containing your API Key for the Youtube API v3 api.
- Next, restart the server and it should work.
